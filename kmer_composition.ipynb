    "The constructed code uses a collection of k-mers and a simplified De Bruijn graph-based assembly technique to recreate the original string. It starts by creating k-mers from a DNA sequence that is created at random. After that, it constructs a representation of a De Bruijn graph, in which nodes stand in for (k-1)-mers and edges for k-mers that overlap. The goal of the procedure is to locate an Eulerian path—a path that travels around every edge in the graph precisely once—in it. This route lines up with the string that was rebuilt. The last character of the last node is appended, and the first character of each node in the Eulerian path is concatenated to complete the reconstruction. "
